# LuhnModN
JavaScript Implementation of Luhn Algorithm with Mod N

The Luhn mod N algorithm is an extension to the Luhn algorithm (also known as mod 10 algorithm) that allows it to work with sequences of non-numeric characters. This can be useful when a check digit is required to validate an identification string composed of letters, a combination of letters and digits or even any arbitrary set of characters.
